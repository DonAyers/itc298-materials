Example code - Hapi.js
======================

This is a simple server running on Hapi, which loads Markdown files, parses them into HTML, and sends them back to the browser. It also supports a simple Handlebars template, to demonstrate how views work. To run this server, you should clone this repo, then run ``npm install`` to download its dependencies before running the ``index.js`` script with Node.

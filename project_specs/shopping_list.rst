Project spec: Shopping list
===========================

It's always a hassle to get to the grocery store and realize that you've forgotten your list. To solve this problem, create a simple, mobile-friendly application that lets users carry their list with them as long as they have a smartphone.

Must-have requirements
----------------------

* Provide an interface where users can create and edit their shopping lists, possibly from a desktop computer.
* Provide a mobile view for each list that does not include editing, but is aimed at grocery-store tasks (checking items off)
* Let users browse through multiple lists, sorted by category/title/tags

Nice-to-have requirements
-------------------------

* Only allow authenticated users to see their lists
* Let users create new lists from the un-checked items on a previous list
* Create "list templates" that can be re-used each shopping trip
